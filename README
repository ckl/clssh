Helper script for using ssh and scp, Reads an external file of servers with
login names and port. The -l parameter specifies a username to login as. This
parameter can also be specified in the server list, but you may use -l to
override it.

The format of the external file must be comma separated in the form of:
alias,host,port,login

Here is the typical usage of the script, followed by some examples:

$ clssh [-l login] <ssh/sd/gt/mnt/umnt> host [file|mount point]
where
  ssh  -> ssh to the server
  sd   -> send file to host
  gt   -> get file from host
  host -> host name as found in server file
  file -> file to send/get from host if using sd or gt
  
  Notes: 
   * The -l parameter is required unless a login name is included in
     the server list file
   * The mnt option requires sshfs (fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html)
   * The umnt option requires fusermount
   * For mnt/umnt options, a mount-point is necessary.
   * For umnt option, the host parameter is not needed.

Examples:
  $ clssh ssh home              # ssh to home server using login provided
                              # in the server file
  $ clssh -l jake ssh home      # ssh to home server with login name jake

  $ clssh gt home ~/umn/cscixx/labreport1.doc
    ^ Downloads labreport1 into the current directory on local machine

  $ clssh sd home ~/.bashrc
    ^ Sends my .bashrc file from the local machine to home server

  $ clssh mnt home /path/to/mount
    ^ uses sshfs to mount home directory for login at the mount point

  $ clssh umnt /path/to/mount
    ^ unmounts whatever is mounted at this path
